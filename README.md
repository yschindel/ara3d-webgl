# Ara 3D WebGL - BIM Open Schema Viewer

## [Demo](https://ara3d.github.io/ara3d-webgl/)

A **WebGL viewer** for extremely large 3D models of buildings and infrastructure 
represented as [BIM Open Schema .BOS files](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-schema).

BIM Open Schema is an ultra-compressed and portable BIM data format, which 
is easily extended, built on top [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format.
A .BOS file is a ZIP archive that contains multiple Parquet files, which contain
geometry, parameters, and other BIM data.

## Building and Running 

The project uses [vite](https://vite.dev/) for bundling and development. 

Some of the common tasks, which can be found in the `package.json`.

- `npm run dev` - Running the vite dev server with "hot reloading" 
- `npm run build:docs` - Building the examples and API documentation. 
- `npm run serve:docs` - Testing the built examples and API documentation locally 
- `npm run build:lib` - Building the library as a JavaScript module (`.mjs`) file

## History

At Ara 3D we created a simple 3D web-viewer in March 2019 which had support for multiple file formats. 
The goal was to minimize the amount of code required to create and host a Three.JS viewer in a web-page. 

The VIM team took over the project in July 2021 and the team, mostly Simon Roberge, 
added many features and enhancements. They also customized the project to meet the needs of their Power BI offering.

On December 17, 2024, the VIM team archived the project, and merged it with their React-based viewer project into a 
new repository https://github.com/vimaec/vim-web. Today the VIM viewer is very powerful, but has become very specialized 
to their use-cases.

In early 2025 the Ara 3D WebGL project was forked from an earlier snapshot of the repo to revive the spirit of the original viewer, 
while leveraging many of the excellent contributions made by VIM.

Today in December 2026, we are focusing on using this viewer as a showcase of the [BIM Open Schema](https://github.com/ara3d/bim-open-schema)
data format.
